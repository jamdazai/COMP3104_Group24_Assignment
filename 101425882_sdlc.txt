DevOps is essential in modern software development, bridging development and operations teams to foster collaboration and continuous improvement. By leveraging automation, continuous integration,
and continuous delivery (CI/CD), DevOps streamlines the software development life cycle (SDLC). This results in faster delivery of high-quality software while minimizing risks and costs.

Importance of SDLC
-Structured Approach: Ensures systematic management of development phases.
-Risk Management: Identifies and mitigates risks early.
-Quality Assurance: Ensures thorough testing for higher quality.
-Resource Management: Optimizes time and cost allocation.
-Stakeholder Communication: Enhances communication and documentation.

Importance of DevOps
-Faster Delivery: Enables quicker releases and shorter cycles.
-Improved Collaboration: Fosters teamwork between dev and ops.
-Increased Efficiency: Automates tasks to reduce errors.
-Continuous Improvement: Supports rapid feedback and enhancements.
-Scalability: Facilitates efficient scaling of applications.
-Enhanced Security: Integrates security practices throughout development.
