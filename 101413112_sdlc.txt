The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to develop software applications efficiently and effectively. It consists of several phases, including planning, requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase has specific deliverables and milestones, ensuring that the project stays on track and meets stakeholder expectations. By following the SDLC, teams can improve project visibility, enhance collaboration, and minimize risks, ultimately leading to the successful delivery of high-quality software that aligns with user needs and business goals. 

Moreover, the SDLC promotes a systematic approach to software development, facilitating continuous improvement and adaptability to changes throughout the project lifecycle. This iterative nature allows teams to refine their processes and products based on feedback and evolving requirements, fostering a culture of innovation and responsiveness in software development.
