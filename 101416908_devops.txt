COMP 3104: DevOps Course Overview

The DevOps course introduces the integration of development and operations practices to improve collaboration, automation and efficiency across the software development lifecycle. 
The goal of DevOps is to break down silos between teams, enabling continuous delivery of high quality software.

Key concepts covered in the course include:

1- Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Automating the process of integrating code changes, testing and deploying software to ensure faster and more reliable releases.

2- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine readable configuration files rather than manual processes, making environments consistent and scalable.

3- Containerization: Using tools like Docker and Kubernetes to create lightweight portable containers that can run applications across various environments without compatibility issues.

4- Cloud Platforms: Leveraging cloud services such as AWS and Azure to host, scale and monitor applications ensuring they perform efficiently in production environments.

The course focuses on teaching students the tools and methodologies that streamline the development, deployment and monitoring of applications. By implementing practices such as automated testing, continuous deployment

and infrastructure management, students learn how to promote faster software releases with higher reliability.

Additionally, the course emphasizes the importance of monitoring and feedback loops to identify issues early, make continuous improvements and ensure the system's overall stability and performance.
