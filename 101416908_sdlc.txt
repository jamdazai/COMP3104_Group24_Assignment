      ----SDLC----                The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process
                                  used to develop software systematically and efficiently. It ensures 
                                  that the software meets user requirements, maintains high quality 
                                  and is delivered within the agreed timeline.

                                  The SDLC consists of the following key stages:

                                  Planning: Defining the project scope and determining the necessary 
                                  resources and timeline. This stage also includes risk assessment 
                                  and setting the project objectives to guide the development process.

                                  Requirements Gathering: Identifying and documenting both functional 
                                  and non-functional requirements. Clear and precise requirements ensure 
                                  the project team understands exactly what the software should achieve 
                                  and how it should behave.

                                  Design: Creating system architecture, user interface and database designs. 
                                  This stage transforms requirements into a blueprint for building the software 
                                  focusing on both logical and physical aspects of the system.

                                  Development: Writing the code based on the design specifications. The 
                                  development team builds the actual product ensuring that all features 
                                  and functionalities work as intended according to the defined requirements.

                                  Testing: Verifying that the software functions as expected and fixing any defects. 
                                  This involves various levels of testing including unit, integration and system tests 
                                  to ensure the software is free of bugs and meets quality standards.

                                  Deployment: Releasing the software for use in a live environment. This may include 
                                  installing the software on users' systems, setting up hosting environments or 
                                  preparing cloud infrastructure to handle production traffic.

                                  Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, bug fixes and updates to ensure the 
                                  software remains functional. This includes addressing user feedback, improving 
                                  features and ensuring the system remains secure and up to date with evolving 
                                  requirements and technologies.

                                  The SDLC provides a roadmap for developing software that meets users' needs 
                                  while adhering to quality standards and deadlines. By following the SDLC 
                                  development teams can manage complexity, reduce risks and improve overall 
                                  project success rates.
