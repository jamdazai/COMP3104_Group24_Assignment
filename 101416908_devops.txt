                                      COMP 3104: DevOps Course Overview

              The DevOps course introduces the integration of development and operations practices 
              to improve collaboration, automation and efficiency across the software development lifecycle. 
              The goal of DevOps is to break down silos between teams enabling continuous delivery 
              of high-quality software.

              Key concepts covered in the course include:

              1. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Automating the process of integrating 
                 code changes, testing and deploying software to ensure faster and more reliable releases.

              2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through 
                 machine-readable configuration files instead of manual processes, making environments consistent 
                 and scalable.

              3. Containerization: Using tools like Docker and Kubernetes to create lightweight portable containers 
                 that can run applications across various environments without compatibility issues.

              4. Cloud Platforms: Leveraging cloud services such as AWS and Azure to host, scale and monitor applications, 
                 ensuring they perform efficiently in production environments.

              5. Version Control Systems: Understanding how to use version control tools like Git to track code changes, 
                 collaborate with team members and manage software releases effectively.

              6. Monitoring and Logging: Implementing tools that track system performance and capture logs, enabling quick 
                 identification and resolution of issues in production environments.

              The course focuses on teaching students the tools and methodologies that streamline the development, 
              deployment and monitoring of applications. By implementing practices such as automated testing, 
              continuous deployment and infrastructure management, students learn how to promote faster software releases 
              with higher reliability.

              Additionally, the course emphasizes the importance of monitoring and feedback loops to identify issues early, 
              make continuous improvements and ensure the system's overall stability and performance.

              The course also encourages a culture of collaboration where development, operations and security teams 
              work together throughout the software lifecycle to build, test and release software more efficiently.
