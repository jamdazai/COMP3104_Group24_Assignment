The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to develop software systematically and efficiently. It ensures that the software meets user requirements, maintains high quality, and is delivered within the agreed timeline.

The SDLC consists of the following key stages:

Planning: Defining the project scope and determining the resources and timeline.
Requirements Gathering: Identifying and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements.
Design: Creating system architecture, user interface, and database design.
Development: Writing the code according to the design specifications.
Testing: Verifying that the software works as expected and fixing any defects.
Deployment: Releasing the software for use in a live environment.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates to ensure the software remains functional.
The SDLC provides a roadmap to develop software that meets users' needs while adhering to quality standards and timelines.
