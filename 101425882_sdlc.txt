-The Software Development Cycle-
DevOps is essential in modern software development, bridging development and operations teams to foster collaboration and continuous improvement. By leveraging automation, continuous integration,
and continuous delivery (CI/CD), DevOps streamlines the software development life cycle (SDLC). This results in faster delivery of high-quality software while minimizing risks and costs.

Importance of SDLC
-Structured Approach: Ensures systematic management of development phases.
-Risk Management: Identifies and mitigates risks early.
-Quality Assurance: Ensures thorough testing for higher quality.
-Resource Management: Optimizes time and cost allocation.
-Stakeholder Communication: Enhances communication and documentation.

Importance of DevOps
-Faster Delivery: Enables quicker releases and shorter cycles.
-Improved Collaboration: Fosters teamwork between dev and ops.
-Increased Efficiency: Automates tasks to reduce errors.
-Continuous Improvement: Supports rapid feedback and enhancements.
-Scalability: Facilitates efficient scaling of applications.
-Enhanced Security: Integrates security practices throughout development.

-Key stages of SDLC-
-Planning: Define project goals, requirements, and scope, involving all stakeholders to ensure alignment.

-Development: Write and build the code, often using agile methodologies to enable iterative progress.

-Testing: Conduct automated and manual testing to identify bugs and ensure the software meets quality standards.

-Deployment: Release the application to production environments using CI/CD pipelines for efficient and reliable deployment.

-Monitoring: Continuously monitor the applicationâ€™s performance and user experience to identify issues in real-time.

-Feedback: Gather user feedback and performance data to inform future improvements and iterations.

-Maintenance: Regularly update and maintain the application, addressing any bugs or performance issues and implementing new features as needed.
