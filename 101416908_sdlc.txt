                                  The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process
                                  used to develop software systematically and efficiently. It ensures 
                                  that the software meets user requirements, maintains high quality 
                                  and is delivered within the agreed timeline.

                                  The SDLC consists of the following key stages:

                                  Planning: Defining the project scope and determining the necessary 
                                  resources and timeline.

                                  Requirements Gathering: Identifying and documenting both functional 
                                  and non-functional requirements.

                                  Design: Creating system architecture, user interface and database designs.

                                  Development: Writing the code based on the design specifications.

                                  Testing: Verifying that the software functions as expected and fixing any defects.

                                  Deployment: Releasing the software for use in a live environment.

                                  Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, bug fixes and updates to ensure the 
                                  software remains functional.

                                  The SDLC provides a roadmap for developing software that meets user's needs 
                                  while adhering to quality standards and deadlines..
