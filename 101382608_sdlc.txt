DevOps plays a critical role in modern software development by bridging the gap between development and operations teams, creating a culture of collaboration, and promoting continuous improvement. 
Learning DevOps is essential because it enables developers to streamline the entire software development life cycle (SDLC) through automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CI/CD). 
This leads to faster delivery of high-quality software while reducing risks and costs.
